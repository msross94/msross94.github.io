We study the implications of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunica-
tions Commission’s (CRTC’s) Third-Party ISP Access (TPIA) regulation, which re-
quires ISPs to allow third-parties to sell internet access on their networks at a price
set by the CRTC. We develop a model of household’s internet plan choice and usage,
and flexibly estimate it using a unique household-level panel of data from 2020-2022.
We then calibrate a model to entry decisions by third-party providers to recover fixed
entry costs. Using the model estimates, we find that consumer welfare is strictly de-
creasing in the wholesale price due to increased third-party entry, while ISP revenues
are non-monotonic.
